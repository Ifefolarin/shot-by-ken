        Every person and story is precious, and I want to give each client my
        utmost attention to guarantee the quality of my work and time. Iâ€™m
        excited to go wherever your love story is taking me and looking forward
        to hearing from you! At summer I am between France, Italy and all over
        the Europe, and will be happy to be at your wedding wherever it will be
        located at any time.
